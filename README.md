# @bristom/commitlint-config

The Bristom pattern for git commmit messages using the commitlint tool.

This package is meant to be used with the [@commitlint/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/cli) and git hooks. Check the availability for your language.

It was initially wrote to be used with Node.js and [Huksy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky). But since git hooks are available in any git repository for any language, you can use the commitlint CLI with any language (but keep in mind you must have Node.js installed to run the CLI globally).
